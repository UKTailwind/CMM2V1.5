/* sqlite_cmm2.h: SQLite's build settings on the CMM2, included ahead of every file (make.py: -include). They are
   usqlite's (lib/usqlite/usqlite_config.h, MIT, Copyright (c) 2021 Elvin Slavik), as the MicroPython port builds
   SQLite 3.47.0 and ran its tests on a G2 (2 Nov 2026), with two changes (docs/SQL_Plan.md):
   - the progress callback is kept (usqlite leaves it out), so that Ctrl-C can stop a long statement;
   - the pool is sqlcore.c's sqlcore_pool, chosen at start-up by the memory there is, as the MicroPython port's
     cmm2_sqlite_pool: 2 MB on a G2, 512 KB on a G1. */
